+ When Flask receives a request from a client, it needs to make a few objects
  available to the view function that will handle it. The obvious way would be
  to pass in the request object to the view function as a parameter, but then
  every view function declaration would have a extra parameter.
    * To handle this flask uses contexts to make certain objects globally accessible
    * Extra note: A tread is the smalles sequence of instructions that can be
      managed independantly.

USING FLASK BOOTSTRAP:
  Many of the blocks in the twitter bootstrap are used by the flask-bootstrap
  package. When using the styles and scripts blocks, you must use {{super ()}}
  to pull in the scripts.

PYTHON DICTIONARIES :
  + A python dictionary is pretty much an associative array or a map. Unlike
    sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed,
    by keys, which can be any immutable type; stings and numbers can always be keys.
    Tuples can be used as strings as long as they only strings, numbers, or tuples.
