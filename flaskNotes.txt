+ When Flask receives a request from a client, it needs to make a few objects
  available to the view function that will handle it. The obvious way would be
  to pass in the request object to the view function as a parameter, but then
  every view function declaration would have a extra parameter.
    * To handle this flask uses contexts to make certain objects globally accessible
